Mount And Blade Warband is a popular action role-playing game that lets you create your own character and lead a band of warriors in medieval battles. The game has a loyal fan base that enjoys its realistic combat, sandbox gameplay, and modding possibilities. However, some players may not be able to afford the game or want to try it before buying it. That's why some people look for a crack version of the game that can bypass the serial key verification and allow them to play for free.

In this article, we will show you how to install Mount And Blade Warband Crack 1.168 13, which is the latest version of the game as of April 2023. This crack works for both the retail and the steam versions of the game and also enables multiplayer mode. However, we do not condone piracy and we recommend that you support the developers by purchasing the game if you like it.
 
## Step 1: Download the Game
 
The first step is to download the game from a reliable source. You can either download the retail version from ftp://ftp.taleworlds.com or the steam version from https://store.steampowered.com/app/48700/Mount\_\_Blade\_Warband/. The retail version is about 600 MB while the steam version is about 2 GB. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive before downloading.
 
## Step 2: Download the Crack
 
The next step is to download the crack files from a trusted website. You will need three files: mb\_warband.exe, steam\_api.dll, and steam\_api.ini. These files will replace the original ones in your game folder and allow you to play without a serial key. You can find these files on various websites, but we recommend this one: https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=1474. This website also has a cheat engine table that you can use to activate various cheats in the game, such as god mode, infinite arrows, one hit kills, etc.
 
## Step 3: Install the Game
 
Once you have downloaded the game and the crack files, you need to install the game on your computer. If you downloaded the retail version, run the setup file and follow the instructions. If you downloaded the steam version, run the steam client and log in with your account. Then go to your library and click on Mount And Blade Warband. Click on install and wait for the download to finish.
 
## Step 4: Apply the Crack
 
The final step is to apply the crack to your game folder. To do this, you need to copy and paste the three crack files (mb\_warband.exe, steam\_api.dll, and steam\_api.ini) into your game folder. The location of your game folder depends on whether you installed the retail or the steam version. For the retail version, it is usually C:\Program Files\Mount&Blade Warband\. For the steam version, it is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MountBlade Warband\. You may need to grant administrator permission to overwrite the original files.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy the Game
 
Congratulations! You have successfully installed Mount And Blade Warband Crack 1.168 13 on your computer. Now you can launch the game from your desktop shortcut or from your steam library. You can play single player or multiplayer mode without any problems. You can also customize your character, join a faction, recruit troops, siege castles, participate in tournaments, trade goods, and more.
